# Performance optimization dependencies for Freqtrade
# UPDATED: Numba compatibility issue discovered - using pure NumPy approach

# Numba 0.61.2 explicitly rejects numpy â‰¥2.3, but freqtrade requires numpy 2.3.2
# Therefore, we're implementing pure NumPy vectorization optimizations instead
# This maintains production compatibility while still achieving significant performance gains

# Optional Numba support (for future compatibility when numpy 2.4+ support arrives)
# numba>=0.61.0,<1.0.0; python_version>="3.11" and numpy<"2.3"
# llvmlite>=0.44.0,<1.0.0; python_version>="3.11" and numpy<"2.3" 

# Additional performance utilities (all compatible with numpy 2.3.2)
# scipy  # For advanced mathematical functions if needed
